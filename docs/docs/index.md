Welcome to the **Prancer** documentation!

**Prancer** is a cloud infrastructure validation framework used to satisfy cloud governance requirements.

**Prancer** is a **pre-deployment** and **post-deployment** validation engine to verify your cloud resources. It integrates to your current DevOps process to validate the required guardrails in place.

# Editions of Prancer

The documentation of **Prancer** will give a lot of information regarding our main product which is **Prancer Basic**. **Prancer** comes in 2 different editions which are incremental:

* **Basic** edition is the community available tool that allows you to run validations on a continous improvement/continuous delivery system such as Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo and so many more.
* **Enterprise** edition is the subscription and paid edition that offer additional tools such as a web interface and it allows you to run it on-premise. It simplifies running the system in parrallel mode using a database as a storage engine instead of a filesystem.

Note that the **Enterprise** edition is also available in a **SasS** offering so you do not have to install and maintain it.
